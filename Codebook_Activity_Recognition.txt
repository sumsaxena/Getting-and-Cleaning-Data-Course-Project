The features selected in this database are sourced from the data provided for "Getting and Cleaning Data" course on Coursera. The data can be sourced from:

The original data set had two datasets- test and training. Each data set had data from from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ (a total of 531 variables). Accompanying each data set, were two additional data sets describing Activity(Walking, Walking Upstairs, Walking Downstairs, Standing, Sitting and Laying) and Subjects (1-30).

For both data sets, Activity and Subjects were added as additional columns. The two datasets were then merged together.
 
From the merged dataset, only variables that contained "Mean" or "Std" (Standard Deviation) were selected. The Activity_Recognistion.txt contains average of each of these variable for each Activity and each Subject.

The data can be read in R by using:
data<- read.table(file_path,header=T)
view(data)
